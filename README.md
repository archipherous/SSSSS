# SSSSS

S5 is an attempt to build a simple python script that processes a static website from Markdown files. It results partly from my own obsessive need to build everything myself, but also to not have to deal with the over-engineered cluterfuckery of programs like Jekyll, Hugo, and Pelican.

The goal is to enter a single command and it spits out a website. It relies mostly on pandoc and all of the page templates are built accordingly. I'll upload those eventually too.

# Buyer Beware

This is an initial version of the script that assumes a folder structure and variables that are specific to my own website and that I haven't documented yet or made plug-and-play for other users. If you're feeling masochistic enough to try and figure it out, you're welcome to.
